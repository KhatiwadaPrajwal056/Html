                Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr.
                and Nadine da Silva. He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.
                Neymar comments on his father's role. <br> "My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family".
                Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.[16] Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up,
                helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight spaces.
